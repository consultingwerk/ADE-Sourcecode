File: defextnt.i

Description:
   Include file that defines the extent of a widget.  This is called by
   _gen4gl and quikcomp to assure an array is defined once and only once.
   When an array variable is found defextent is called to produce the
   "EXTENT n " phrase of a DEFINE statement.  To do this defextent loops
   through the _U records of the same name as the current one to find the
   largest _SUBSCRIPT to determine "n".  While looping, it is making the
   _SUBSCRIPTs negative to indicate that this variable has been processed.
   This assures that the same variable is not output twice.
Input Parameters:
   <None>

Output Parameters:
   <None>
