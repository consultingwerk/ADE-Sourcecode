  qbuild.i:  Create a 4GL query based on
     &TblLIst  - A &SEP delimited lIst of tables each elements of the
                 form "table" or "table2 OF table" or "table3 WHERE table ..."
     &JoinCode   - A CHAR array containing JOi_qbiN information
     &Where      - A CHAR array of WHERE expressions.
     &SortBy     - A CHAR string or variable containing the BY phrase.
     &OptionList - A CHAR string that contains options:  The expected options
                   are INDEXED-REPOSITION, NO-LOCK, SHARE-LOCK, EXCLUSIVE-LOCK
                   (and KEEP-EMPTY)
     &TblOptList - A CHAR string that contain a comma delimitted list of query
                   option each entry can contain Fields Used (oposite of All Fields),
                   LAST or FIRST (alternatives to EACH), or OUTER (opposite of INNER).
     &Sep1       - the delimiter character in &TblList 
     &ExtTbls    - iXternalCnt (the count of external tables)
     &Mode       - False for access within the QB, True if origin is UIB's qbuild.p
     &Preprocess - TRUE if you want to add a tilde to proprocessor expressions
                   (You need this if you want to include the query IN a
                    preprocessor like (&OPEN-QUERY)
     &EOL        - Line seperation character to use in &4GLQury
     &use_dbname - IF FALSE then don't use the DBNAME in the generated query
   Output:
     &4GLQury  - A query of the form 
                 " EACH table1 WHERE condition lock-type,
                       EACH table2 OF table1 WHERE condition2 lock-type"

  ** didn't always work this way.  Instead, the joins were synchronized with the
  ** table and where arrays (i.e. table1 has where1 and join1). In v7.3A, the
  ** joins were constructed for table2 thru table-n but taking lagging 1 (i.e. 
  ** table2's join came from join1, table3's join came from join2). Table1, btw,
  ** never had to worry about joins because they never had the 'OF' or 'WHERE' keywords
  ** in their composition so the join code was never attempted (if it had it would have
  ** resulted in an array subscript of 0).
