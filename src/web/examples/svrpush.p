  svrpush.p
  
  This program demonstrates how to use server push with WebSpeed. Several 
  customer records are output one at a time with a pause between each record.  
 
  For this program to work, there must be a way of sending output to the web 
  server without it buffing any output destined for the browser.  On most 
  Unix web servers, this can be done with the No-Parse-Headers (NPH) mode.  
  With most Windows web servers, just starting any output with "HTTP" causes 
  the web server to switch to this mode.  Please consult the documentation 
  for your web server software for information on this mode.

  Note: This program has been tested with the cgiip messenger only.
 
  Configuring for Unix:
    Make a symbolic link from a working cgiip Messenger script to one with 
    the same name but with an "nph-" prefix.  For instance:
      ls -s wspd_cgi.sh nph-wspd_cgi.sh
    Use the nph- version of your messenger script to access this program.
 
  Configuring for Windows NT:
    This depends entirely on the web server.  Try running the program as is.
