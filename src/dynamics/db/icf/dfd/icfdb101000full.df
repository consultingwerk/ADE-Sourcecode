  DESCRIPTION "This table is contained in Dynamics for backward compatibility and will likely be dropped at a later stage. It will be replaced with flows and events when these are fully implemented.

The purpose of this table is to provide a mechanism to define alternate procedures for custom specific business logic.

This table contains a list of all the system supported procedures that satisfy these business rules, categorised by entity and procedure type. A number of variations for each process may exist - the procedure to use in each case must be selected from this list.

The programs that these procedures exist in will run persistently when required."

ADD TABLE "gsc_data_tag"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines generic tags that may be assigned to data via the gsm_tagged_data table.

The core Dynamics framework utilises the tag mechanism to identify which data belongs to and is shipped with the core product using a tag ""ry-own"", e.g. to identify which object classes and related data belong to the core Dynamics product and should not be modified by users of the framework.

Applications could use the tag mechanism to tag data that belongs to specific applications, or for any other generic purpose.

The data in this table would need to be deployed as part of Dynamics and would typically only be relevant at design and deployment time rather than used as part of the runtime application. For example, rules could be applied to tagged data to prevent unauthorized or accidental modification of the data as design time, and tags could be used to help identify what data to deploy as part of an application.

A generic mechanism is required in the framework to be able to easily attach data tags to data, typically from a browse view but also from within viewers when maintaining a specific record. Additionally, a central tool is required to maintain and manage multiple tags together.

API's also need to be provided to make it easy to identify and work with tagged data as necessary.

Session / configuration data will be required to configure how to operate on specific tags for specific purposes, e.g. to disable certain data due to ownership rules.

ADD TABLE "gsc_deploy_dataset"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the sets of data that need to be deployed to end-user sites and migrated to different workspace databases. Usually it is static data that needs to be deployed. This table with its child table gsc_dataset_entity identify which data must be deployed as a set, i.e. has dependancies. For example, in order to deploy menu items, objects on the menu item would also need to be deployed.

These tables also define the dataset for deployment of logical objects managed by the scm tool, e.g. the ryc_smartobject and related tables.

To deploy and load the data, xml files will be generated for the dataset.

The dataset must always have a main table that is being deployed, plus all related tables that need to be deployed with it, together with appropriate join information.

Example datasets could be for SmartObjects, menus, objects, etc. It is likely that a seperate dataset will be defined for most data tables that need to be deployed, but that these datasets will include a parent dataset that includes this dataset.

When automatically generating triggers from ERWin an entity-level UDP (DeployData) is used to indicate whether trigger code should be generated for the static tables to support data deployment. A flag also exists in the entity mnemonic table called deploy_data for the same purpose.

For customer sites that receive a dataset deployment, the last deployment loaded for this dataset is record here. This helps identify at what version the current static data is for a particular database.

Customers should not modify or deploy from datasets sent by suppliers. The customer can however create their own datasets containing the same tables and deploy from these datasets. As a dataset deployment includes an xml file registered as part of the deployment, the customer can simply utilise this xml file for their database and any subsequent databases and sites they wish to pass the data on to."

When this flag is set to YES, any updates to any of the dataset entities will result in an update of the version_number_sequence field in gst_record_version record, for the primary entity in the dataset.

By default this is set to NO and must be manually enabled. This is done to avoid the overhead assiciated with inadvertantly setting this functionality on when it is not required.

It is only necessary to enable data versioning where we need to track what data has changed in tables to know what to deploy. If we set the flag to NO, then all the data in the table or a manual selection of data would be deployed with no knowledge of what HAS to be deployed because it has changed.

The entries in this table will be system owned by ther nature, and the only fields that may change are the owning_obj and the default_value. The changing of any of these values will create a new record for the owning_entity_mnemonic and default_type, efffective as of the new date with the new values.

Entries may not therefore be deleted from this table, other than by a system administrator."

  DESCRIPTION "This table contains instance attributes used in the application. Instance attributes change the behaviour of generic objects. For example, a generic object could be developed that behaved differently in a creditors and debtors system. An instance attribute of creditor or debtor could be posted to the program when run to determine its instance specific functionality.

The instance attribute will be posted to the program either via the menu option the program was run from, as setup in the menu option, or hard coded in a program if the program was run from a button, etc.

For this reason, certain instance attributes will be system owned and cannot be maintained / deleted by users.

When security structures e.g. field security are setup, they may be defined globally, for a specific product, product module or down to individual program level. The instance attribute is a level below the program level that permits security settings per instance of a program.

Instance attributes will also be used for reporting to allow reports to be printed direct from menu options. The instance attribute code must map to the report_procedure_name in the report_definition table. Whenever a report definition is created, an instance attribute should automatically be created to facilitate this functionality.

  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the logical services available to the application.

A logical service is a separate process running either locally or remotely that requires connection parameters to establish communication between the client and the service. 

Logical service names are unique so that connection to the service can be completely abstracted from the developer. 

The physical service will determine the actual connection parameters.

Which physical service is used is determined by combining the session type with the logical service.

Logical services for appserver service types would in fact be appserver partition names. Logical services for database connection service types would be the logical database name.

This table supports the registration of services and whether they are connected at start of a session is controlled by the connect_at_startup flag. This would typically be set to YES unless the service type is a webservice, in which case it would be NO typically due to the potential slow connection performance of webservices.

ADD TABLE "gsc_manager_type"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table contains the definition of the standard manager types that are used in the framework.

A predefined set of manager types will exist in this table that support the framework functionality. Only managers that directly affect the core functionality of the framework need to be defined as manager types.

For example, without a session manager we cannot start any other code, without a security manager we cannot do user authentication, etc.

The physical procedures to run for this manager type are defined in this tables and two standard ones are supported;

The bound manager object should be run for sessions that have a database connection, i.e. have a service type of database connection as one of the session services. This manager therefore requires a database connection and communicates directly with schema tables.

The unbound manager object should be run for sessions that do not have a database connection, i.e. do not have a service type of database connection as one of the session services. This manager therefore does not require a database connection and communicates indirectly with schema tables via the bound manager object running server side in a session with a database connection.

In order to support overrides of standard manager functionality, the super procedure attribute can be used against the manager object to define a super procedure stack of override functionality. It would point at a specific procedure to add as a super procedure, which in turn could have a super procedure, etc.

The bound and unbound manager fields may need to be customized to point at the last procedure in the super procedure stack, so these fields need to be defined as fields that do not get overridden by new deployments to ensure that the customizations do not get lost. This is defined in the axclude fields field of the gsc_dataset_entity table.

The manager objects specified here are always started for any session type that includes this manager type as a required manager type, via the gsm_required_manager table. We therefore do not support the ability to start different manager objects for different session types. If this is required, then different manager types must be defined."

ADD TABLE "gsc_object_type"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the types of programs supported. A record will need to exist for the various support templates, e.g. ""Object Controller"", ""Menu Controller"", ""SmartFolder"", smartbrowser, smartviewer, smartdataobject, etc.

When objects are created, they must be assigned an object type.

The object type is used as a grouping mechanism for security, to allow restrictions to be created for certain types of objects, rather than having to setup security for every object.

A recursive join exists for the object type to facilitate definition of object type hierarchies (class hieararchies). This is then useful for attribute inheritance at multiple levels of object type.

For example, an object type could be defined for a fill-in, then a child of this may be an integer fill-in, then a child of this may be an object id, etc.

the extends object type means the inherit from object type.

To support customizations for object types (classes), a custom_object_type_obj may be specified that identifies an additional class structure to include as part of this class, e.g. to add additional custom attributes and class super procedures. This facilitates adding customizations to a class in the middle of the hierarchy without having to modify the hierarchy itself, i.e. without having to change the extends_object_type_obj of the subclasses to point at the new custom class.

The custom class if specified is added below the class it is customizing, e.g. if customizing the data class with a custom class datacustom, then at runtime datacustom will be added as a subclass of data overriding / extending the behaviour of all objects that further extend data. All classes below data will therefore automatically now extend the custom class datacustom rather than data - thereby adding datacustom in the middle of the class hierarchy.

The custom class itself may include a structure below it, e.g. provide multiple levels of customization, in which case all of these customizations will be inserted below this class, and classes that previosuly extended this class will rather extend the class at the bottom of the customized classes. For example if the custom class datacustom included an additional subclass, datacustom2 that extends datacustom, then the subclasses would then point at datacustom2, which would point at datacustom, which would then point back at the original class, data.

The field custom_object_type_obj will be specified in the deployment datasets exclude field list so that it is never overwritten as part of deploying changes to the class structure, therefore avoiding the loss of the customizations with future upgrades.

ADD FIELD "cache_on_client" OF "gsc_object_type" AS logical 
  DESCRIPTION "This is a logical flag, defaulting to NO. If set to YES, then this object type (class) is one that should be generated into a .p procedure for use as a persistent client side cache. This would typically be set to YES for ADM object classes that require an ADMPROPS temp-table and are rendered, e.g. folders, dynamic viewers, browsers, sdo's, etc.

The .p for the class will contain the definition of a dynamic temp-table with a field for each attribute used in the class including all classes the class inherits from. This is typically a big temp-table, with possibly around 200 fields, with the initial value being the value of the class attribute.

By generating these .p's and deploying them to the client, we avoid passing this data over the network at runtime, which will significantly improve performance over slow lines.

Once the big class temp-table is built, the only data that needs to be transfered over the wire at runtime is for attributes that have been overridden at the master or instance level.

The Dynamics framework will be shipped with this flag set to YES for the most common classes that satisfy the criteria. Applications built on Dynamics may modify this as required. when doing new deployments of class data, this field will not be overwritten for existing classes."

If the sequence number is to be automatically generated, then there can be no holes in the sequence numbers, which is why a Progress sequence will not be used.

Example uses for this table would be for the automatic generation of document numbers, transaction references, etc."

  DESCRIPTION "This entity describes the different types of services available to applications and provides the management procedures for the different types of connections.

To illustrate, database services, AppServer services, Webservices and JMS partitions are all different service types. The Database, AppServer and Webservice services are system owned.

The maintenance object defines the datafield object used to maintain the physical connection parameter attribute on the physical service table. For example, if this is a service type for database connections, then the datafield may allow the specifiction of -S -N and -H prompts independantly and then put the result as 1 field into the connection parameter.

In the case of webservices there are many connection parameters, some of which are only known at runtime. To support this, the connection_parameters field on the physical service supports substitution lists. The substitution list contains token value lists delimited by CHR(1), the token and value are delimited by CHR(3).
The tokens are %parametername or a special token %DynUserID that is replaced by the Dynamics user id of the current user.  For example, tokens can be defined for parameters as follows:
WSDL UserId = %WSDLUserId
WSDL Password = %WSDLPassword
SOAPEndpoint UserId = %DynUserID
SOAPEndpoint Password = %SOAPEndpointPassword
MaxConnections = %maxConnections

The management object is the api procedure that is responsible for making the physical connections to the service.

In the case of an appserver partition, the default logical service could point at the default logical appserver partition to use.

For field security to be activated, entries must be created in the security structure table, as it is this table that is allocated to users, and allows the field security to be restricted or different in various parts of the application.

Usually developers will create appropriate fields, and users may then assign them to certain parts of the application via the security structure table.

ADD TABLE "gsm_filter_data"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the filters that are applicable to a filter set, and a filter set can have many filters that apply. 

By default, the include flag will be set to NO, indicating the specified criteria must be excluded from the result set. If the include flag is set to YES, then this will be treated as an override condition to re-include specific data. This will work by building up a bracketed where clause for all the exclusions, using the AND operator, and then outside this bracket, performing an OR operator for any data that must be re-included - allowing overrides for specific data. Clearly this must be used sparingly to avoid potential performance problems.
The table can be read as meaning to exclude all specified data except the data that is specifically included back in. For example, exclude all objects in all repository modules, except for objects where the template flag is true or the object type is a toolbar.

If a specific record is to be specified, then the owning_reference field will point at the object id for that table. For example, if the owning_entity_mnemonic is GSCPM for gsc_product_module, then the owning_reference will point to a specific product module product_module_obj.

Alternatively a more generic expression can be specified, by supplying a fieldname, e.g. object_filename, an operator, e.g. BEGINS, and a value, e.g. ""standardtoolbar"".

It is not possible to specify a generic expression and a specific record, one or the other must be specified in a single filter data record.

This table provides significant flexibility in the specification of what data to filter. It will be possible for example to specify a list of product modules to exclude, but to re-include specific objects from some of the excluded product modules.

We use user profile codes to assign a filter set to a user, rather than setting the flag, display repository data yes or no. If no filter set is allocated to a user, then no filters apply. Only a single filter set may be applied at any one time.

ADD TABLE "gsm_flow_step"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table contains the steps that have to be followed to complete a flow.

Each step may involve the running of an object, the running of an internal procedure within an object, or the execution of another complete flow.

The flow steps may be customised for specific login organisations so that entire steps may be replaced with custom specific code. 

The standard flow steps will be specified with a 0 login company. Within a single flow the login company can either be 0 or a specific company. When running each step it will first check for a customisation for the login company and if not found will just run the standard step. 

If a customisation is found, this may either be an additional step in which case the custom step will be run first, or else it will be a complete replacement of the standard step.

It is also possible to add custom steps that do not have any standard code at all, i.e. no step with a 0 login company exists. This facilitates adding customisations after the standard behaviour.





 and so setting up company specific steps would involve copying the default flow steps to a specific login company in full and then customising the specific steps as required. If the standard flow is modified, customised steps would also need to be manually modified as appropriate.

ADD TABLE "gsm_login_company"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This framework table defines login companies (organisations) and is used to provide a list of valid companies the user may log into at runtime.

It is intended that this table will link into an external application database where additional details will be stored for the login company, e.g. address and contact information. The code or the object field could be used as the xref into the external application database.

The table is required in the framework to facilitate the generic set-up of framework data specific to login companies, e.g. security allocations, automatic reference numbers, etc.

The existence of a login company in the framework supports the concept of holding multiple company application data in a single database as apposed to having separate databases for each company. Application databases would further have to link to this table or a corresponding table in their database design to filter appropriate data for each login company.

We only hold on this table the minimum details as required by the framework. Applications that also have an organisation table will need to replicate modifications from their full organisation table into this table in order to simplify and syncrhonise maintenance of this data.

ADD FIELD "propagate_links" OF "gsm_menu_item" AS character 
  DESCRIPTION "This contains a comma seperated list of links to propagate. The links must be specified with the -source or -target suffix to indicate the direction of the link being propagated.

For this to work, a menu toolbar must exist with an instance attribute of menu. It does not need to be visualised but must exist. The reason is that it would be too dangerous to just propagate links direct from a container.

Selecting the menu item will propogate any specified links to/from the menu toolbar through to the program being run, thereby bypassing the menu toolbar. The link could also be further directed by the program to an object in the program if an additional link existed between the container and the object with the same link name.

For example, we could have a link from a browserA to a menu toolbar called link1-target. The toolbar runs a new program B. If link1-target is in the list of propogate links, then a link will be created between  browserA and programB. If programB has a subsequent link1-target link from its container to another object called viewerC, then the link will actually be routed from browserA to viewerC.

This in effect is a generic pass through link mechanism.

This table includes support for structured nodes. A structured node is a node where each new level is created infinitely from the same SDO, thus meaning that a node can be expanded infinite times and these nodes does not have to be set up for each level in node control.

An example of the structured node field values for setting up a structured node treeview on this table would be;

structured_node - YES
parent_node_filter - parent_node_obj = 0
parent_field - parent_node_obj
child_field -  node_obj

The appropriate data will be hidden from the user.

For range security to be activated, entries must be created in the security structure table, as it is this table that is allocated to users, and allows the range security to be restricted or different in various parts of the application.

Usually developers will create appropriate ranges, and users may then assign them to certain parts of the application via the security structure table.

ADD TABLE "gsm_release"

  DESCRIPTION "This table provides a mechanism to record what versions of an object belong to a release, when used in conjunction with the child table, gst_release_version.

This table identifies an actual release, giving the release a specific reference, summary and detailed notes of the reason for the release, and details of when the release was created and by whom.

The release number will usually be an auto generated reference, using the gsc_sequence table to control the generation. The release number should contain the site number as part of the reference to indicate which site the release originated from and to avoid conflicts.

When creating the release, a gst_release_version record must be created for every gst_record_version, marking the current version number of all data as of this release.

This can then be used to determine what data needs to be deployed between releases, i.e. what data has been modified between the releases by checking for matching version numbers in the gst_release_version table.

Examples of the types of data that is mapped includes object types and product modules. This facilitates the external SCM tool using different codes than those used in Dynamics. It also allows mutiple codes in Dynamics to share a common code in the external SCM tool, e.g. many product modules and object types in Dynamics could point at common modules and subtypes in an SCM tool such as Roundtable.

The scm foreign key field is the field in the external SCM tool. This is a character field for maximum portability. API's should be used to provide lookup lists for values in the external SCM tool.

Data must be set up in this table for SCM integration to function, so that it is clear what data is mapped to what. If it is a one to one mapping, then tools can be used to synchronize the data and set it up automatically.

One table is used rather than a usage table for each of the above as the fields are identical, and if another type is introduced, no major rewrites will be required as this table will automatically support it.

The security restriction may be assigned globally, in which case the product module, object and instance attribute will be 0.

Alternatively the restriction may be allocated to a product module, a specific program object, or even an insance attribute for a program.

A restriction must be assigned to this table for it to be active at all. It is entries in this table that are allocated to users.

  DESCRIPTION "The session service table defines the different physical services for each session type in order to establish the logical service.

For example, an AppServer may require a shared memory connection to the repository database whereas a client session would require a network connection to the same databases. The physical connection parameters are different for each of these. Therefore the logical service identifies the database that needs to be connected and the physical service describes the mechanism for the connection dependant on the session type.

If no session service record exists then the logical service can only run locally.

ADD TABLE "gsm_session_type"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "A session type is a namespace for grouping specific types of sessions together.

For example, a ""receipting workstation"" would be a specific session type while a ""salesman's web agent"" could be another.

Each session type is combined with a physical session type that maps to a list of known Progress 4GL run-time environments. 

Thus, ""receipting workstation"" may be mapped to a 4GL GUI client while ""salesman's web agent"" could be mapped to a WebSpeed Transaction Agent.

Thus you could create any number of session types mapping them to specific 4GL session types.

Where different managers, etc. need to be pre-started for different applications, then the different applications would be defined as new session types.

In order to run locally without appserver connections, etc. you would need to define a new session type that connects to appropriate databases and has no session service records for the appserver logical services thereby forcing them to not connect and rather simply use the session handle for code portability. Also, this new session type would define a different set of managers to run, i.e. run the server side managers locally.

We will provide a facility to change the session type on the fly (if possible).

We have a recursive join to the gsc_session_type table to support inheritance of settings across multiple session types. This will make the modification, re-use and creation of session types much simpler. The program that generates the icfconfig.xml file will simply read the extra details from the linked session types and write out an accumulated set of configuration details.

This table also holds parameter details for the session, such as whether to support failover and inactivity timeouts for sessions."

ADD TABLE "gsm_status"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "The actual valid status codes are set-up in the category table. For example:

related entity mnemonic = GSMST for gsm_status
category type = STS for Status
category group = HST for History
category subgroup = COD for Code

The category subgroup is the actual status in this case. The categories of status will always be system owned and mandatory. The category mandatory flag will be used to indicate whether an object at this status may be modified.

At least 1 record must exist in this table for every category subgroup that has a related entity mnemonic of status (GSMST). This record will be system owned, have a sequence of 0 and may not be deleted. It will always be the default status for this category subgroup.

This table allows users to modify the narrative of the status, and add extra status's within the same category subgroup to represent their internal business processes.

From a business logic point of view, when the status changes within the same category, we do not need to do anything and the user may do this manually via a combo box. The change of status from 1 category to the next within a category group will usually be done via a business logic process.

We will always need to join back to the category table to determine what status an object is at from a business logic point of view.

The status an object is at effective from a specific date is determined by an entry in the status history table, which means the status does not need to be added to every table it is used for. However, in some cases we have linked objects directly to the status table to show the current status for performance reasons."

A specific item of data may contain any number of tags for various purposes, but a specific tag may only be allocated once to a specific item of data.

As tags are generically attached to data, the schema triggers for data that may have tags attached will need to ensure that the tags are deleted when the data is deleted - like the mechanism used for generic comments and auditing."

Tokens may be created for any tab page names or button labels, being careful to ignore any shortcut characters and ... suffixes. The tokens must then be added to the security structure table to become active. The security structure table facilitates the token being restricted for a specific object instance, specific object, specific product module, or generically for everything.

The software will only check security providing a valid enabled token exists for the button label or tab folder page.

If a user has no tokens allocated at all, then it is assumed they have full access (providing security contol is set to full access by default). Once a user is allocated tokens, then security comes into force and the user will only be granted access for folder pages and buttons they have been granted access to (an that have restricted access set up).

Example tokens would be add, delete, modify, view, copy, page 1, page 2, etc.

This table defines extra user information for this system, and allows a user to be optionally associated with a person to facilitate full name, address, etc. details to be entered for a user as well as comments.

There is a logged in flag on this user record to facilitate the identification of user availability (a user is available if they are logged into this application).

The existence of this specific user table in our database also facilitates automatic referential integrity.

  DESCRIPTION "When a user logs into the system, they log in with a user id, and a select a company (organisation). This table defines the security options for the user when they log into a certian organisation. The user may have different security options when logged into different companies.

If the organisation_obj is 0, then the security allocation applies to all companies. Likewise, if the user_obj is 0, then the security allocation applies to all users logged into this company. User security will always override company security. In addition, and owning_obj of 0 always indicates no access to all the data for that entity mnemonic (not supported for security structures, or menus - only really for data).

This table generically assigns all security options for the user / company. The standard options that may be specified via the owning_entity_mnemonic and owning_obj are:

gsm_security_structure records for security relating to tokens, fields and ranges.
gsm_menu_items for securing access to menu items
gsm_menu_structure for securing access to menu structures
gsm_entity_field_value for securing access to generic entity field values e.g. companies.

Additionally, access to any entity data can be secured using this table. For example, to secure access to specific cost centre codes in a general ledger, the owning_entity_mnemonic could be the cost centre table, and the owning_obj used to allocate specific cost centres the user / company has access to.

The rules applied to this table for the entity in order are as follows:
0) If security is disabled, then user security is passed.
1) If a specific record exists for the user / company then security is passed
2) If a specific record is found for the user / company with an owning_obj of     0, security is failed
3) If not full access by default, and no entries exist for the user at all, including     all users and all companies, security is failed
4) If a record exists for all users or all companies with an owning_obj of 0,     then security is failed
5) If a record is found for all users, security is passed
6) If a record is found for all companies, security is passed
7) If full access by default and no records are found at all for the specific     user, all users, or all companies, then security is passed.

Some allocations require additional data, e.g. allocating a field restriction needs to determine what can be done with the field, e.g. View, Update, Hide, etc.

Entries must exist in this table for all security allocations. There is no option for inclusion or exclusion to make querying as fast as possible. The maintenance programs however should allow the specification by inclusion or exclusion for fast data entry - then create / delete all relevant entries in this table.

ADD TABLE "gst_context_scope"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the scope of the server context data, either by session or by user.

If the context scope is for a user, then the context data in gsm_server_context will persist across sessions and will remain valid for the user until it is deleted or expires (as determined by the flag on gsc_security_control indicating after what period user context data should expire). This facilitates storing context for a user that can be re-used in new sessions, e.g. shopping cart information that can persist between web sessions. For user context scope, the session_obj will be set to 0 and a valid user_obj must be specified.

If the context scope is for a session, then the context data in the gsm_server_context table will only be valid for the duration of a single session. In this case the session_obj will be specified and the user_obj will be 0.

A name is given to the scope record to identify the scope. This is mainly useful for context scoped to a user, and can be used via APIs to retrieve specific types of scope. Where the scope name is not required or specified, it will simply be automatically set to the string value of the context_scope_obj so that it has a unique number. The scope name is only unique for active context (transaction complete is no) and once context is complete, the scope name is irrelevant and can be duplicated. This unique validation must therefore be handled in code.

When dealing with transaction data, many context scope records could exist for a single session for a single transaction, and where this is the case, the parent scope object id identifies which scope records together form the complete transaction. The record with a parent of 0 is the top parent scope. An example of where this is necessary is on the WEB when dealing with parent and child data, e.g. order and order lines as a single transaction across multiple web pages. An order may contain many order lines, and each order line will have a common set of fields but with different values in each case, so the data stored in the gsm_server_context table needs to point at a different context scope record to handle the same data fields existing in context for different records. This allows us to gather up context data across multiple web pages for multiple records, and commit the entire set of data as a single transaction.

The transaction complete flag is only set for the top parent context scope where the object id is 0, and indicates that the transaction is finished and may be tidied up by the garbage collector. The session complete flag on gst_session can override this if that is set to YES and this is session scoped context data. Additionally, the scope name must be unique for context scope where the transaction complete flag is no.

  DESCRIPTION "A name is given to the scope record to identify the scope. This is mainly useful for context scoped to a user, and can be used via APIs to retrieve specific types of scope. Where the scope name is not required or specified, it will simply be automatically set to the string value of the context_scope_obj so that it has a unique number. The scope name is only unique for active context (transaction complete is no) and once context is complete, the scope name is irrelevant and can be duplicated. This unique validation must therefore be handled in code.

ADD FIELD "transaction_complete" OF "gst_context_scope" AS logical 
  DESCRIPTION "This is a flag, default value is NO.

When dealing with transaction data, many context scope records could exist for a single session for a single transaction, and where this is the case, the parent scope object id identifies which scope records together form the complete transaction. The record with a parent of 0 is the top parent scope. An example of where this is necessary is on the WEB when dealing with parent and child data, e.g. order and order lines as a single transaction across multiple web pages. An order may contain many order lines, and each order line will have a common set of fields but with different values in each case, so the data stored in the gsm_server_context table needs to point at a different context scope record to handle the same data fields existing in context for different records. This allows us to gather up context data across multiple web pages for multiple records, and commit the entire set of data as a single transaction.

The transaction complete flag is only set for the top parent context scope where the object id is 0, and indicates that the transaction is finished and may be tidied up by the garbage collector. The session complete flag on gst_session can override this if that is set to YES and this is session scoped context data. Additionally, the scope name must be unique for context scope where the transaction complete flag is no.

ADD TABLE "gst_record_version"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table provides the means for identifying when static data is changed and needs to be deployed. 

When an item of data on a record changes, the replication trigger on the table will check if the version_data flag on the gsc_entity_mnemonic table is switched on. 

If the flag is on, either a record is written to this table or an existing record in the table is updated to indicate that the data has changed by incrementing the version_number_seq and resetting date, time and user. 

This table is checked every time the deployment data is written to ensure that all data that matches the deployment criteria is written out.

Basically any records with a version_number_seq greater than 0 has been changed locally and potentially needs to be deployed. Once an import is done for a record, the version_number_seq is set back to 0 indicating the data matches that since the last import and has not been modified since.

When importing data, the import_version_number_seq is used as a validity check and if this number does not match the import_version_number_seq of the data being imported or the current version_number_seq does not match, there is a potential conflict.

This will mean that where object ids are used for keys, we will also store some other unique key information about the table if available, that would have been used as an alternative by the deployment procedures to locate the record. For example, in the case of the ryc_smartobject table, the key_field_value will contain the smartobject_obj and the secondary_key_value will contain the actual object name.
We cannot make this field unique as it may not always be used, but it will be indexed together with the entity mnemonic. If the field is used for an entity, then code will prevent duplicate alternate key values as this should never occur due to the new data resurrection functionality this facilitates.
Triggers for master tables will check the gst_record_version table where the secondary field is used and see if a new record is being created with a previously used key value, and if so, will change the object id to match the previously used object id. This will ensure when resurrecting old data that the object id is never modified, and help prevent data conflicts when deploying data.

Its purpose is to be able to record session activity and manage the context for the session in the child table gsm_server_context. The session id field from gsm_server_context has transferred to this table, so it only exists in one place for the session, and the object id for the session record is rather carried down onto the individual context records. This facilitates efficiently fixing the context id in the event a session is dropped and reconnected, thereby restoring context for the new session from the old session. For the Appserver, a record will be created in this table at connection time and checked / updated in the activate procedure.
This table must not have a write trigger so that it can be updated as efficiently as possible.
The information in this table is all client related, and in the case of a WebSpeed Agent, the agent is also the client.

ADD TABLE "ryc_attribute"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the attributes that may be allocated to objects, e.g. size, position, window title, query, where clause, etc. They are used to defined the properties of dynamic objects, plus to dynamically alter the behaviour of static objects.

Certain attributes are required for the application to function correctly and these will be set to system owned to prevent accidental deletion. Only users that are classified as able to maintain system owned information may manipulate this data. In many (most) cases, the actual attribute label will need to match to a valid Progress supported attribute.

Due to the powerful feature of allowing attributes to be defined at various levels, most dynamic data about smartobjects will utilise attributes.

Example areas that we will utilise attributes for include browser query, sort order and where clauses, container window titles, which window to run based on various button actions in a browser, e.g. add, modify, view, etc., status bar configuration, page enabling and disabling, field enabling and disabling by object instance, whether toolbar items are included in the menu, etc.

If this field has a value, then the functions to get and/or set this property need to physically exist and be used and overrideable, to allow them to contain additionally logic beyond simply retrieving the value from ADM-DATA. This is the equivalent of defining the xp preprocessors in the ADM but is more flexible in that it differentiates between get and set.

It is the set calls that are most expensive at startup, so this is an important field.

Note that in code when checking this value, a CAN-FIND should be used to ensure the order of the get,set is irrelevant.

DIALOG-R
This is like the dialog option, but makes the attribute value field read-only forcing the use of the dialog. This is necessary for dialogs that would return delimited lists that you would not want users to manually enter.

  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This entity associates attributes with object types, smartobjects, and smartobject instances, and specifies the value of the attribute in the appropriate native data type or character if a native data type is not available for the data type.

The list of attribute values defined for the object type (class) must be complete, and unless an attribute is defined at the class level, it will not be available to be set within a subclass. Attribute values are not cascaded down to subclassess and entries will only exist at subclass levels for overrides. To read all the attribute values for an object, attributes for parent classes must also be read.

Records will then only exist for subclassess in the event the value has been specifically overridden for that subclass.

When creating entries in this table for attributes associated with an object type, then the smart object and instance will be 0.

When creating entries in the table for a smartobject, we will also populate the object type field to avoid having 0 in the key. Likewise when creating attributes for an object instance, we will populate the object type and the smartobject. This ensures effective use of the alternate keys.

Note: We must be careful when looking for attributes associated with an object type to ensure we look for the specific object type and 0 values for the smartobject and instance fields.

Where multiple rendering engines are supported and used, the render type object id adds another dimension to the possible attribute values.

It is possible to specify a specific rendering engine type for attributes at the class, master and instance levels. If an attribute is specified at the class level for a specific rendering engine type, and not for a 0 rendering engine type, then that attribute will only ever be used for the specific rendering engine type and will not apply across all rendering engines.

Attributes that have their design_only flag set to YES would never need to be used at runtime. Additionally, attributes that have their runtime_only flag set to YES are never read from the repository at runtime as they are just working attributes used during rendering rather than requiring to be stored in the repository.

Any attributes stored at the class level, i.e. with smartobject_obj = 0 would also have this flag set to NO as class attributes are cached upfront and do not need to be read at runtime.

The use of this flag minimizes the number of attributes that need to be processed at runtime.

ADD TABLE "ryc_customization_result"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "The table is required to store possible customization codes as a result of some level of customization. Many types of customization exist, including UI type customizations (e.g. HTML, DHTML, GUI), user category customizations, user customizations, company level customizations, etc as defined in the ryc_customization_type table.  To avoid confusion and to provide some level of control as to the use of the result codes, a result code must be for a specific customization type.

The table will basically contain a code and description field. Meaningful codes and descriptions should be used to avoid conflicting uses of result codes. The table is also joined to the customization type to identify which type of customization the result code is for. 

For user level customizations, example result codes could be individual user login names, e.g. Bruce, Anthony, Don, etc. Alternatively the customization results could be defined rather by job function, e.g. operator, administrator, clerk, etc. For UI type customizations, the result codes could be DHTML, HTML, GUI, PDA, etc. For language customizations, the result codes could be English, French, German, etc. Another possibility is customizations by user category, in which case the result codes would represent valid categories, e.g. data capturer.

This provides maximum flexibility as to how much customization is required. 
The customization types simply define the various levels of supported customization, and the result codes define the possible values each customization type can be. The customization result table could therefore be viewed as a list of valid values for a customization type.
Certain result codes, such as supported UI type customizations will be provided as part of the framework. These result codes will be defined with a system owned flag set to YES, and maintenance of these codes will be restricted to users authorized to maintain system data. Care should be taken when defining these framework supplied result codes to avoid potential conflicts with result codes used by Dynamics applications.

The third character can also be a ""C"", meaning that the object should be centered within the row (or within the remaining available space in the row), or ""R"", meaning that the object should be right justified within the row.  SmartDataObjects and other non-visual objects are automatically assigned to row ""0"", since they do not actually appear in any way at runtime.
So for example, a window or page with a Toolbar at the top, and an SDO, followed by a Browser, under that a Viewer, and another Toolbar at the Bottom, would assign to those objects the layout positions ""M11"" for the toolbar, ""M01"" for the SDO, ""M21"" for the Browser, ""M31"" for the Viewer, and ""B11"" for the Bottom Toolbar.

The use of the name field therefore emulates the alias functionality that exists within SDO's.

The field is not forced unique for migration purposes and also to cope with scenarious where instance names need not be forced. Uniqueness of the name should however be forced in code where applicable, and the instance name should be defaulted to the object name of the instance.

  DESCRIPTION "This table stores relationship information for tables in the Dynamics repository and application databases built using Dynamics.

Multiple relationships can exist between the same parent and child table if required, so one of these must be flagged as the primary relationship to use initially when joining between the two tables.

The relationship reference field is unique so that it can be referenced in code if required, where multiple possible relationships exists and application functionality depends on the relationship. Where the relationship reference is irrelevant, it can be automatically generated using the Dynamics sequences.

The attributes about the relationship map closely with the attributes supported by ERWin from Computer Associates.

The fields used to join the tables in the relationship are specified in the child table ryc_relationship_field.

The contents of this table should be automatically populated from information exported from a case tool such as ERwin, to make synchronization of changes as automated as possible.

This table, once populated, can be used to support generic application functionality such as automatic object generation, referential integrity trigger code, etc.

It is envisaged that at some stage in the future, the information in these tables will be replaced with support for relationships in the core language meta schema.

An identifying relationship means that the child table is totally dependant on the parent table. If this flag is set to YES, then the nulls_allowed flag cannot be YES as the join must be mandatory.

A mandatory join however does not necessarily indicate an identifying relationship. To be identifying, the child table really has to be a sub-table of the parent. Where the parent field is simply an attribute of the child table (foreign key) then the relationship is not really identifying.

When using ERwin, if the relationship is flagged as identifying, the foreign key fields are forced into the primary key of the child table, which is not always what you want. For this reason, when using ERwin, most relationships are flagged as non-identifying but no-nulls which has the same affect, just without the forced primary key fields.

The identifying flag is for the most part just for information purposes and to force the setting of the nulls_allowed field. It is really the nulls_allowed field that is the important one.

The join sequence determines the order to reference the fields when constructing a dynamic where clause to join the tables.

When joining to some tables, additional constant values for fields in the child table or parent table may need to be specified and this functionality is supported. 

An example of this in the Dynamics repository is when joining from the gsc_object_type table to the ryc_attribute_value table, where there is a single field from the parent table, the object_type_obj, but we must additionally specify a 0 value for other fields, eg. container_smartobject_obj, smartobject_obj and object_instance_obj. This means that when using constant values, the child or the parent field may be left blank.

  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the supported rendering engines, e.g. e.g. WEB, GUI, HTML, B2C, .NET, XML, etc. 

It is joined into the gst_session table to identify for a session which rendering engine is active for that session.

The main purpose of this table is to optionally join into the ryc_attribute_value table and ryc_ui_event table to provide an ability to override attribute values and events for different rendering engines at the class, master and instance level. The render type offers another dimension of customization capability specifically for rendering engines.

This also supports the ability to identify certain attributes and events that are only applicable to specific rendering engines, as well as the ability to override the values of common events and attributes across rendering engines."

ADD TABLE "ryc_ri_default"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the default referential integrity (RI) rules to apply when manually maintaining relationships in the ryc_relationship table.

The rules in this table will be used to default the parent and child actions based on the value of the identifying_relationship and nulls_allowed fields.

The standard set of RI defaults used by Dynamics are as follows:

For identifying and non-identifying but will no nulls the defaults are:
Child Delete = None
Child Insert = Restrict
Child Update = Restrict
Parent Delete = Restrict
Parent Insert = None
Parent Update = Restrict

For non-indentifying but with nulls allowed the defaults are:
Child Delete = None
Child Insert = Set Null
Child Update = Set Null
Parent Delete = Set Null
Parent Insert = None
Parent Update = Set Null

These are usually correct apart from the need to sometimes change the delete rules for the parent to cascade, and soemtimes even when a relationship allows nulls, you still want a restrict rule rather than a set null rule.

ADD TABLE "ryc_smartobject"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table represents every object known to the repository, whether static or dynamic. All objects that can be run should be registered in the repository, including all visual objects, business logic, etc. Images for buttons, etc. should also be registered.

The only files not registered in the repository are include files.

Having the files registered allows them to be added as instances to containers, added to menus, have security applied to them, run them as part of flows and events, automate deployment of them, etc.

Many child tables exist to further define an object, and which tables apply depend on the object type. For example, information regarding links, pages, instances, etc. only pertain to objects that are containers. Even with containers, not all tables may apply, as viewers, browsers, and sdo's are containers for datafields but do not have the concept of pages, only window containers have pages, links, etc.

Certain object properties are only applicable to physical objects. Previously this table was broken into two, and th second table, gsc_object used to define physical properties. This was removed in V2 to improve performance and resolve many issues associated with this, hence some redundant fields in certain object types.

For versioning to work, we have turned off RI that would have prevented an object being deleted if it is used on a container - this is to allow imports and object assignments to work. This RI must therefore be manually coded where required.

We turned off the automatic delete cascade of smartobject attributes as it was also deleting attributes for instances of the smartobject when we did not want it to. Added a specific delete trigger customisation that rather joined on the primary_smartobject_obj in the attribute table when deleting attributes, to ensure only attributes for the smartobject were deleted, not also instance attributes.

This table optionally supports customization using custom result codes.The unique key to this table is made up of the object filename and a result code, allowing the same object name to exist with multiple result codes, each custom object containing what behaviour has been added or overridden. The object with a 0 result code is the master default object, and this must always exist.

In this way, any of the fields on this table, plus information in tables where this is the parent may be customized by result code. Tools support for this however may be limited initially.

Whenever reading a smartobject based on the filename, the result code must also be specified, using 0 if looking for the master.

A recursive join with a rolename of extends_smartobject_obj has been added to this table to support inherritance. This functionality however as of V2 has not been implemented into the framework. The intention is to allow objects to inherit from (extend) other objects, therefore facilitating changes to master or template objects being cascaded down to subclasses or instances, by reading up the class structure.

For V2, the inherittance functionality has just been added at the object type level."

ADD TABLE "ryc_ui_event"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This entity stores information about UI events for a smartobject. It works very similar to the ryc_attribute_value table in that UI events can be associated with object types, smartobjects, and smartobject instances.

This allows the attachment of UI events to dynamic objects.

When creating entries in this table for events associated with an object type, then the smart object and instance will be 0.

When creating entries in the table for a smartobject, we will also populate the object type field to avoid having 0 in the key. Likewise when creating events for an object instance, we will populate the object type and the smartobject. This ensures effective use of the alternate keys.

Note: We must be careful when looking for events associated with an object type to ensure we look for the specific object type and 0 values for the smartobject and instance fields.

Events are not cascaded down to subclassess and entries will only exist at subclass levels for overrides. To read all the events for an object, events for parent classes must also be read.

Where multiple rendering engines are supported and used, the render type object id adds another dimension to the possible events.

It is possible to specify a specific rendering engine type for events at the class, master and instance levels. If an event is specified at the class level for a specific rendering engine type, and not for a 0 rendering engine type, then that event will only ever be used for the specific rendering engine type and will not apply across all rendering engines.

ADD TABLE "rym_customization"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table captures the actual customization results for the various supported types of customization as defined in the ryc_customization_type table.

This table is joined from the ryc_customization_type table with a mandatory join to define the type of customization. It contains a customization_reference field as part of the unique key to store the value for the customization according to the type. For example, if this was a user level customization, then the reference field would contain a specific users login code. If this was a UI type customization, then the reference field would contain the value of a UI type, e.g. HTML, GUI, etc.

This differs from the values in the customization result table. The customization result table is a list of valid value result codes for the customization type. This table represents actual values that can be checked at runtime with the appropriate api and the values may differ to the result code values. The result code values are reusable.

For example, one customization type is user customization. In this customization table we could have a record for each user with the reference pointing at the user login name, e.g. Anthony, john, bruce, etc. The api specified for the customization type would be run to find the current user and lookup in this table what the specified result code is for the user. The result code for Anthony could be manager, and John could also point at the same result code, but Bruce may point at result code engineer. Note the possible reuse of result codes and the difference between the result code values and the customization references.

The table stores the result for the customization via a join to the customization result table, identifying the result code to use for this specific customization.
These tables then provide maximum flexibility for customization possibilities.
As stated previously, the resultant result codes for a session will be evaluated after authentication and made available to the session.

When reading from tables that support customization, e.g. the smartobject and related tables, the appropriate record will be read with a matching result code of the highest priority level, if any matching customizations exist, otherwise the default record will be used.

A generic tool will need to be developed to capture these customizations.

It is used to forward engineer the object into the full Repository, generating all appropriate smartobject instances and attributes. Many assumptions are made regarding the look and feel of a standard ICF TreeView Controller which significantly simplifies the data that must be captured.

More complex specific modifications to an object may be made using the standard Repository Maintenance options.

This table also facilitates generation of the object into different UI's, e.g. Java.

This is a comma-separated paired list of database field names in the Data-Target and RowObject Temp-Table fields in the Data-Source that should be used for opening the Data-Target's database query using one or more key values from the Data-Source.

A good example is joining a customer sdo with an order sdo and the foreign fields would be set to order.cust-num,cust-num.

Note that for each Foreign Field pair, the first entry is the name of the field in the database query for the Data-Target (the child or detail SDO in the parent-child or master-detail relationship), which is Order.CustNum in our example. This first entry is expressed as the database field name (optionally with the table qualifier) because that fieldname will actually be inserted into a where clause used to open the database query for the Data-Target, resulting in FOR EACH Order WHERE Order.CustNum = <CustNum-value-from-Data-Source>. The second entry in the pair is the name of the key field in the Data-Source SDO which is to be compared to the database field in the Target, or CustNum in our case. This must be the name of the field as it occurs in the Data-Source SDO column list (no DB table qualification) because the Source SDO is providing that value from the SDO's temp-table, not straight out of the database. Each time the dataAvailable event is published by the Data-Source, indicating that its query on Customers has been re-positioned, the Data-Target (Order) SDO will request the value of the CustNum field from the Customer SDO and plug that into the Order query where clause as indicated above.

We need to be able to control and automate what tasks to do as part of the DCU for a specific release, at what stage they should be run, whether each step completed successfully, the order of the steps, etc.

Certain tasks can only occur after the DCU has finished, but before anybody starts using the system and the tasks require a valid login to complete. Currently we have no way of controlling or automating this, which is the primary reason for the table. This table will significantly improve the load-n-go functionality within Dynamics and help prevent migration and deployment issues.

The DCU will update this table from the information in the .pfl file that the DCU uses as the source of the information for the DCU.
