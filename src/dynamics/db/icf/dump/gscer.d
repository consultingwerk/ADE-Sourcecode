Before you verify that you want to change the Product Module, read the following implications of making such a change:

* If you use a Source Code Management (SCM) tool, it might not allow you to change the Product Module of the selected object. (You should check your SCM tool guidelines first.)

* When you change the Product Module of an object, Progress Dynamics moves the object in the repository, but it does not move its associated Application Data Object (ADO) file on the disk. You must manually move the ADO file from the old Product Module directory to the new Product Module directory in the central repository. If you do not, you could experience problems when you deploy your application in a distributed development environment. If you deploy datasets without first moving the ADO file, Progress Dynamics could inadvertently load invalid data into a target repository. 

* If you change the Product Module for a static object you must manually move both the static object file, as well as its associated ADO file, from the old Product Module directory to the new Product Module directory. (The repository only stores the association between the static file and the Product Module.)

* If there are any references to the object using its old relative path, you must change those references so that they use the new object path. (You should not have to do this for a logical object.)
