    Purpose     : Temp-table definition for the LeakCheck's internal object table
    Syntax      :
    Description :
    Author(s)   : pjudge
    Created     : 2022-02-17
    Notes       : * Holds all of the objects created and deleted in a log or logs
                  * Objects are identified by session, group, type and id. For widget-pools, this is not a unique combo since
                    they are not given an internal identifier by the AVM. For all other groups/types, the combo is unique.
                  * When an object is created, the ACTION is CREATE. When deleted, the action is DELETE.
                  * A leak is indicated when there is a CREATE action without a DELETE action for the object. The RelatedObject
                    field should be used to allow a CREATE to reference a DELETE and a DELETE to reference a CREATE
                  * An ACCESS-LEVEL preprocessor is provided for use in classes: it should be a standard, supported access level
                    for temp-tables
                  * A TABLE-PREFIX preprocessor value may be used to add prefix character(s) to the table name.
                  * A FIELD-PREFIX preprocessor value may be used to add prefix character(s) to all field names.
