File: _brwbtn.p (push browse button)

Description:
   Do some stuff that is necessary when the user pushes one of the object
   buttons on the browse window (or when the codes needs to select the database
   object because there are no connected databases).
 
Input Parameters:
   p_Obj       	   - The object type of the button pushed.
   p_Icn       	   - The icon widget for this object type.
   p_Lvl2_Remember - If true: if a level 2 button is currently pushed and
      	       	     we switch to a non-level object, remember which level 2
      	       	     object was current.
      	       	     If false: we don't care to remember.  In fact, reset
      	       	     the flag on both buttons.
