Description:
   Do data type customization.  This means changing visibility or labels
   of fields based on their relevance to the currently selected data type.
   For the fields affected, also take gateway capabilities and other 
   factors into account.

Shared Input:
   s_Fld_Typecode - The underlying code for data type
   s_Fld_Gatetype - The gateway data type.

Input Parameters:
   p_Case - Widget handle for the case sensitive widget.
   p_Dec  - Widget handle for the decimals widget.

History:
    tomn    07/96   Changed code to set the screen-value of the _decimals
                    field to "?" when field was disabled (before, it would set
                    the screen-value to "0").  Some foreign
                    character fields use this field to store length info, and
                    it was being overwritten if/when the "save" button was
                    pressed.  Also, this change makes it consistent with the
                    TTY dictionary.
    D. McMann 06/09/03 Added data type CLOB to check for case sensitivity
