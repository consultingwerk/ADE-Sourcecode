Description: 
   Code to run when we are switching to a different object -
   e.g., because the user clicked on a browse select list entry or
   because the code has changed the selection (because of delete or Next
   etc.)

Input Parameter: 
   p_Obj - The object type of the object selected (e.g., OBJ_TBL)
      
Author: Laura Stern
