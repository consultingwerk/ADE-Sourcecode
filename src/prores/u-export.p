this program exports data in the following fashion:

a) numeric fields are output as regular numbers.
b) dates are written in yyyymmdd format.
c) strings are surrounded by quote marks.
c) logicals are written as 'true' or 'false'.
e) fields are separated by commas.
f) lines are terminated by LF or CRLF, depending on opsys.
