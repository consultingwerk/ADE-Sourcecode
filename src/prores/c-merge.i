c-merge.p returns:

  qbf-schema.cValue = "filename,dbname,0000description"

but warning!  a-join.p alters the structure of this array to be:

  qbf-schema.cValue = "filename,dbname,###,###,....."

where the ### is a list of pointers into qbf-join.cValue of join records
that contains a reference to that file.

qbf-schema% is a scalar of flags to be appended to filenames ("*" or " ")
