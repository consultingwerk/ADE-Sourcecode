/* _wcompil.p - 

    Do a test compile for a WHERE clause input into the
    Where builder dialog box.  We don't use the default
    test compile file built by the Where Builder because
    it doesn't necessarily work in the "Open Query" 
    enviroment as in browse view.  For example if you have:

    DEFINE QUERY q FOR customer.
    DEFINE QUERY q2 FOR invoice.
    OPEN QUERY q FOR EACH customer WHERE cust-num > 10.

    If there are mult tables with the same field in a db, you must
    qualify a reference to that field in a query WHERE clause such as cust-num
    in this example.  It is not like a FOR EACH where you are actually creating
    a little insulated block which has it's own references that get preference.
    The query is "block-less" so its references are general to the block it is 
    enclosed in.  This would give a compiler error that cust-num is 
    ambiguous between customer and invoice.
