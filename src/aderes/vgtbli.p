 *    Return information about a table.
 *
 *  INPUT PARAMETERS
 *
 *    tableName  The table in question. The name should be qualified in the
 *               same manner that the name was found. We look in the
 *               current list of tables.
 *
 *  OUTPUT PARAMETERS
 *
 *    refTable   If tableName is an alias then this variable will
 *               hold the name of base table. Otherwise it is ?.
 *
 *    joinTable  The name of the table that tableName is joined to. See
 *               joinInfo.
 *
 *    joinInfo   How the table is joined to the "n - 1" table in the
 *               table list. The join of the first table in the table
 *               list is always "".
 *
 *    whereInfo  The text of the where clause defined by the user
 *
 *    whereAsk   The information about any clauses that need to be asked.
 *
 *    includedCode The code to be included for this table in the
 *                 respective for-each statement
