   1. When we merge or split sections in the form view (change master-detail)
      the row's of the fields need to be changed so that the fields don't 
      end up on top of each other (merge) or with big gaps at the top of
      a frame (split).
   2. When we've just added new fields, the row and column is left 0
      meaning progress will position them after the previously named field.
      If none of the fields in the section are explicitly positioned, then
      there's no problem.  However, if the existing fields have explicit 
      positions, new fields in the middle of the field list or ones
      at the end of the list which follow a field that is positioned in the
      middle of the display somewhere, will come out overlapping other fields.
      We want to reposition these so there's no overlap - so the user
      is guaranteed to at least see that they're there.
