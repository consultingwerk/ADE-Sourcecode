/* j-pairs.i - Figure out all the pairs of tables that have relationships
      	       and add them to a selection list.

   For example: If we have the following table relationships (left)
      	       	this will generate the following pairs (right)
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
      Customer 	     	      	    Between Customer and Invoice
        Order of Customer           Between Customer and Order
          Order-line of Order       Between Order and Order-line
            Item of Order-line      Between Order-line and Item
          Salesrep of Order         Between Order and Salesrep
        Invoice of Customer         Between Customer and State
        State of Customer

   Input Parameters:
      p_tbl  - The next table id to find relationships for 
      p_list - The selection list widget to add to.
      p_func - The name of a routine to call for each item added to list.
      	       It will be passed p_tbl (a table id) the joined table id,
      	       and the string being added to the select list.
