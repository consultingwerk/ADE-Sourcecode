 *    Recreates the table aliases, relationships involving aliases, and
 *    any "custom" relationship during an application
 *    rebuild. This code will open the ASCII configuration file, looking
 *    only for table aliases and relationships.
 *
 *    This is the easiest way to rebuild, since the rebuild of the
 *    databases could end up with different IDs and such. Instead of
 *    having to try to synch up old IDs with new IDs, we get the information
 *    from the config file and build on the fly. It's not the fastest, but
 *    it is the simplest method to insure that aliases and their
 *    relationships get added back in correctly.
