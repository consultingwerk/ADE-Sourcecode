/*
This code parses the label layout map in qbf-m.  Each number, from 1
through 0, denotes one of the field-name "matches" patterns for field
guessing.  Each "|" in the map means a newline.  Other text is stored,
and if the next symbol "0" to "9" ("0" = 10) is found, and the qbf-t[]
element contains something (meaning that the field-name matches pattern
succeded), then we insert both the prefix and the field into the output
array.  Otherwise, if the field-name slot in qbf-t[] does not contain a
field, we throw away the prefix.  This keeps us from doing stupid
things like including the "-" between the zip and zip+4 when there is
no zip+4 field present.  Any blank lines are squashed out.

The default map for USA is "1|2|3|4|9|5, 6  7-8|0", which is decoded to mean:

  line 1 gets field #1 (name)
  line 2 gets field #2 (address #1)
  line 3 gets field #3 (address #2)
  line 4 gets field #4 (address #3)
  line 5 gets field #9 (city-state-zip)
  line 6 gets field #6 (city),
    also ", " + field #7 (state) if present,
    also "  " + field #8 (zip) if present,
    also "-" + field #9 (zip+4) if present
  line 7 gets field #10 (country)

The old algorithm would omit fields 6 thru 9 when 5 was present.  This
new algorithm doesn't, and depends more on the sysadmin to set things up
sensibly.
