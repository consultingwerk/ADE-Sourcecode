/*
 * _arwrite.p
 *
 *    Writes out the fastload version of the database and relationship
 *    information.
 *
 *    Originally, _awrite handled writing out both the ASCII version and
 *    compiled version of the configuration file. But with the changes to
 *    qbf-rel-tt, the code generation for the table/relationship
 *    information became vastly different in appearance. So, this part
 *    of the code generation merits its own function.
 *
 *  Input
 *
 *    pName   - The name (with extension) of the temporary
 *              file we write out to.
 *
 *    pBase   - THe Base name (without extension) of the temporary
 *              file we write out to.
 *
 * Due to the way database aliases work as well as Progress programming
 * limits we have to bludgeon the code to work. We'll do everything
 * in 2 passes.
 *
 * The first pass walks through the database list and build the controlling
 * program. This program will create the proper database alias and will
 * call the reload programs
 *
 * Then dump the temptable into the individual files
