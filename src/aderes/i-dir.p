 * Some of the things needed to be known about the query directory code.
 *
 *  1. There is an array that holds all of the entries of the currently
 *     selected query directory.
 *
 *  2. When you change directories you change the array.
 *
 *  3. The user is allowed to see the queries of other databases. The
 *     array has all of the queries, including these. Because of this the 
 *     selection list used to display queries may not be 1 to 1. Therefore
 *     this code has to spend time looping through the array to match
 *     current selection with array index.
 *
 *  4. The array index is not the value of the QUEnnnnn.p. There is
 *     an indirection from array slot to query file number.
