/*==========================  DEFINITIONS ===========================*/

DEFINE INPUT PARAMETER df-file-name AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO.
define variable dictOptions as OpenEdge.DataAdmin.Binding.IDataDefinitionOptions no-undo.
 
/* If user wants to commit even if there are errors in the df, they can
   pass in a string composed of "df-file-name,yes"  If user_env[15] is
   set to yes, the _lodsddl.p will handle for committing with errors.
   
   If user wants to load new tables and sequences on-line than df-file-name
   must have three entries, "df-file-name,<commit>,<session parameter>".  
   example:  Commit with errors and loading on-line = "sports,df,yes,NEW OBJECTS" 
             Do not commit with errors and loading on line = "sports.df,,NEW OBJECTS"
             Just passing in file name "sports.df".
