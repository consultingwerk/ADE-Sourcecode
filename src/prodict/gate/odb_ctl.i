/**********************************************************************************************

  The value of "prgrs_clnt" input to _Db._Db-misc2[7] changes from 
    "<vers>" 
     to 
    "<vers>:sh_min=<minvers>,sh_max=<maxvers>."
      where <vers> is the Progress Client Version number
        and <minvers> is the minimum schema holder version compatible with this Progress client
        and <maxvers> is the maximum schema holder version compatible with this Progress client
        <minvers> and <maxvers> are maintained by the Progress client connected to the schema
        holder.

   Db._Db-misc2[6] changes to 
     "Dictionary Ver#: <dict-vers>" + "Client Ver#: <clnt-vers>" + "Server Ver# <srvr-vers>" +
       "Schema Holder Ver# <sch-hldr-vers>" 
      where <sch-hldr-vers> is the current version of the schema holder
      <sch-hldr-vers> is set initially to <minvers> but is maintained by the Dictionary as
        version features are added to the schema holder.

   ** NOTE: There are change requirements in _odb_get.p if these formats are further changed. **

   The schema holder version number is being introduced in Progress client
   and dictionaries in  versions 9.1E03, 10.0B04, and 10.1A.  The progress 
   client version for all these versions will be set to "101".  But the maximum
   compatible schema holder version will only be set to "2" for 10.1A and 10.0B04.
   9.1E03 will have a maximum schema holder version number of "1" meaning 
   incompatibilities with Version 2 schema holder features will exist.

   Since the Progress client and Dictionary are mutually responsible for the content 
   in the schema holder, they should apply the schema holder version in coordinated
   fashion.  The Progress Client passes the schema holder minumum version number to 
   the Dictionary through the GetInfo_buffer.  The minimum value is applied to a newly
   built schema holder unless the Dictionary has a valid reason to override or update 
   that value.  The Dictionary may upgrade the schema holder version number either 
   automatically, because of features inherent in this version of the Dictionary, or 
   conditionally, because of features associated with a newer schema holder version 
   that are enacted in this schema holder through the use of dictionary utilities.  
   NOTE:  It is possible, but unlikely, that a schema holder version number will be
   applied by the dictionary that is  greater than the schema holder version range 
   declared by the client to be supported.  Since the client and dictionary are shipped 
   together, it is not likely that a version of the Dictionary that is incompatible with 
   the current version of the client will be used to maintain the schema holder.
   But the dictionary should test for this possibility just in case the utilities 
   used to build or upgrade a schema holder happen to be incompatible with the current
   client version that uses it.

   Ultimately, the schema holder version number should reflect the level of features 
   implemented in the schema holder through the dictionary and/or Progress client.

   With these changes, Progress clients that are incompatible with new dictionary features,
   or old dictionaries that are incompatible with newer clients can be identified and 
   conveyed to customer.

   Schema Holder Version Change Log:
    --------------------------------
    1 - Is the baseline for everything before OpenEdge Version 10.1A, 10.0B04
        and 9.1E03.
    2 - Introduces an "_" suffix identifier, instead of "#" for array field suffixes
         used against a DB2 database.  The presence of these entries are determined 
         by the dictionary which will conditionally and automatically upgrade the 
         version number in the schema holder's _Db record.

 BUG-1 is the inability to use Search Patterns in a Catalog function  
       for qualifiers.                                                
 BUG-2 is an occasional corrupt of prepared statements at the end of  
       a transaction.                                                 
 BUG-3 is the inconsistency of the sort order of NULL values.         
 BUG-4 is the description of all the components of an index in one row
       concatenating the fields: "fld1+fld2+fld3..."                  
 BUG-5 the support of only one statement per connection.                
 BUG-6 Multiple connection can block each other.                        
 BUG-7 Quoting an identifier does not work.                                
 BUG-8 is the inability to use Search Patterns in a Catalog function  
       for owners.                                                            
 BUG-9 is wrong type values returned from SQLColumnAttributes. To work
       around it, we skip runtime schema comparison.                       
 BUG-10 is not being able to handle WHERE 1 = 2 clauses.              
 BUG-11 NULL is sorted to be the lowest value. Turn BUG-3 off !!        
 BUG-12 Do SELECT <key> not SELECT <flds> - More compatible but slow. 
 BUG-13 Lock/transaction mode 1 support by driver:                          
            Exclusive-lock & Lock Upgrade.                               
              No shared-lock support,

              only scrolling cursors.                                        
          Lock/transaction mode 0 by driver, which is the default:        
              No lock control.                                               
              Use the dbmgr isolation level for concurrency control.        
              By default - One connection only.                               
              no async mode.                                               
              might use non scrolling cursors.                               
 BUG-14 Does not follow the ODBC protocol for the LIKE where clause   
        operator. Wants the type of the value to match the type of    
           the field instead of being specified as SQL_VARCHAR.                
 BUG-15 The db has a "timestamp" field which get updated with each row
           update.                                                        
 BUG-16 We use SQLColumns, at runtime, to get schema info, instead of 
          SQLColumnsAttributes - to prevent waiting on a lock.                
        To avoid a full table scan by not issuing SQL statement        
        "select * from table where 1=2" for Access2 driver             
        ODBCJT16.DLL per bug #95-09-01-043.                           
 BUG-17 UPPER function for the WHERE clause is not supported.                
 BUG-18 This driver needs the hint system.                                
 BUG-19 This driver gives the wrong index uniqueness info.                
 BUG-20 This bug used to only apply to the Informix driver.  It has   
        been revamped to be switched on for all drivers in which the  
        record lock wait state needs to be modified from its          
        data source default.  If the driver doesn't do it, we must.   
 BUG-21 The driver cannot handle FLD LIKE ? phrase. We put                
           FLD LIKE <literal> instead.                                        
 BUG-22 Driver sends wrong data about indexes - don't build indexes   
          automatically.                                                
 BUG-23 The driver has some problems in qualifying object in SQLTab().
        We will qualify, on the client side, the objects for schema   
          import.                                                        
 BUG-24 The driver has some problems with wild cards in SQLTables().  
        We will qualify, on the client side, the objects for schema   
          import if wild cards are used. Note that BUG-23 implies       
          BUG-24.                                                        
 BUG-25 The driver supports WHERE char_fld = <value> even if <value>  
          is longer then what char_fld can hold. We would allow that    
          expression for those drivers.                                        
 BUG-26 The driver has problems with re-using prepared statements -   
        we don't reuse them.                                                
 BUG-27 The driver has problems with join by sql db - do it by client.
 BUG-28 Don't create OWNER.TABLE names, since "OWNER." is added by    
        the Driver.                                                   
 BUG-29 The driver has proprietary ODBC extensions for BLOB/CLOB      
            support. Specifically, the driver uses -98/-99 for these      
        large objects. Progress will translate these to LongVarBinary 
        datatype.                                                     
 BUG-30 The driver supports setting transaction isolation level on        
            a statement basis. I.e., PODBC can change it within a         
            transaction, not just before a transaction begins. Note that  
        per-statement isolation is NOT ODBC V2.0 conformant, but is        
            very useful for Progress.                                                         
 BUG-31 The driver supports the use of % and _ in LIKE string by      
        using brackets around the characters.  Driver doesn't support 
        the escape clause.                                            
 BUG-32 Driver does not support the ESCAPE clause.  There is no known 
        mechanism to use % and _ characters in the LIKE string.          
 BUG-33 Driver does NOT support ASYNC as PODBC prefers, so PODBC will 
        not issue ASYNC_ENABLE  call to driver. Crucial rule that        
        driver must follow is to support polling for call completion        
        by call with truncated parameter list (see dtserror.c).           
        Thus, if this flag on, PODBC will NOT request driver to do    
        ASYNC at Connect time. If flag off, PODBC will request ASYNC. 
 BUG-34 Driver expects databases of the format dbname:owner.table     
        as opposed to dbamae.owner.table.  If the flag is on, then    
          change the format of the full table name to use a :, not dot.      
 BUG-35 This switch indicates that dynamic cursors need to be added   
        to enable the use of server-side cursors in MSSQL.  This      
        indirectly removes the restriction that a cursor be closed    
        before another statement can be executed.                     
 BUG-36 This switch indicates that firehose cursors need to be   
        enabled for MSSQL.
 BUG-37 This switch indicates that transactions need to be disabled
        for tdriver tests.
 BUG-38 SQLColumns returns Type-name as "text" for varchar(max) and
        "image" for varbinary(max).
 BUG-39 Issue specific to Data Direct Wire protocol driver for 
        SQL Server.
