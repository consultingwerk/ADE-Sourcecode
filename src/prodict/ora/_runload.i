        Donna McMann copied from prodict/misc/runload.i so that
        Oracle can do bulk inserts during load.  If any changes
        are made in prodict/misc/runload.i they should also be
        evaluated for this procedure.
  
   {1} - Name of the table to load
   {2} - tolerable load rate (%).  
   {3} - set size, status will be displayed after each set
   {4} - either table name or specific field names to load.
   {5} - expected # load records.  If {2} is either 0 or 100%, then
      	 this is ignored.
