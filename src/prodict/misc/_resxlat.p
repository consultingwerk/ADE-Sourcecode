Description:
    This routine checks wether an object-name is a reserved word by the
    respective foreign DB. If so, it appends an "_". In addition all 
    characters that are not supported by the foreign DB are replaced with
    "_".

Input:
    p_param     <object-name>[,<db-type>]

Output:
    p_param    <corrected object-name>

Changed/Used Shared Objects:
    none

Used Aliases:
    none

History:
    hutegger    01/96   rewritten based on the old version
                        prepared for separate lists per dataserver
                        (i.e: generic list for all DS, generic list
                        for ODBC-based DataServer, special lists
                        for all SQL-based DataServers)
                        I also prepared for separate substitution-chars
                        and/or different unallowed characters.
    jlewis   01/10/96   Added mssqlsrv V6.0 keywords
    hutegger    01/96   Added "&" as unallowed character
    jlewis   02/01/96   Added new Sybase 11 keywords
    jlewis   06/28/96   Added mssqlsrv V6.5 keywords
    dmcmann  01/14/00   Added percent to odbc keywords and changed lookup
                        function.
    dmcmann 07/18/00    Added timestamp as keyword
    dmcmann 07/25/00    Changed l_odb-keywords to include all generic plus
                        all keywords for supported database types. 
    dmcmann  11/18/02   Added freetext for MSS
    dmcmann  03/12/03   Added SYS_ logic in names.
    kmayur   16/01/12	Added check for Progress Keyword
