'You can add special event handlers in this file that will get run automatically when special Active Server Pages events
'occur.  To create these handlers, just create a subroutine with a name from the list below that corresponds to the event
'you want to use.  For example, to create an event handler for Session_OnStart, you would put the following code into this
'file (without the comments):
'Sub Session_OnStart
'**Put your code here **
'End Sub

'EventName               Description
'Session_OnStart      Runs the first time a user runs any page in your application
'Session_OnEnd       Runs when a user's session times out or quits your application
'Application_OnStart  Runs once when the first page of your application is run for the first time by any user
'Application_OnEnd   Runs once when the web server shuts down
