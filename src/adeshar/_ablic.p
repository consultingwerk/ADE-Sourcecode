    Procedure: _ablic.p
    Purpose:   Returns AppBuilder license information.
    Syntax :   RUN adecomm/_ablic.p (INPUT ShowMsgs, OUTPUT ABLic, OUTPUT ABTools).
               
    Parameters:

        ShowMsgs - Yes: procedure displays messages.
                    No: procedure doesn't display messages.
                        
        ABLic    - = 1 when C/S AppBuilder only
                   = 2 when Webspeed AppBuilder only
                   = 3 when Both
                   
                   Note: A license for Enable-ICF extends the existing
                   license AppBuilder or Workshop product and is not
                   itself currently handled as a product. Thus the
                   Enable-ICF license has no affect on the value of ABLic.
                 
        ABTools  - Comma-delimited list that indicates the tool products
                   enabled for the session. The list contains one or more of
                   the following strings:
                   
                   UIB - Product is enabled for C/S AppBuilder
                   Workshop - Product is enabled for WebSpeed Workshop
                   Enable-ICF - Product is enabled for ICF AppBuilder
