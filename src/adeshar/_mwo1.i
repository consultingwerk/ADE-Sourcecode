 *   This file works around a "feature" with mulitple spaces at the end
 *   of a string that differentiate the string.
 *
 *   With this feature if you have a char field with the value "xxx " then
 *
 *   local_char = "xxx  " /* The extra space is intentional */
 *   find first t where char_field = "xxx  ".
 *
 *   returns the row with "xxx " in it.
 *
 *   For menus, we use the separators this way. So internally, replace
 *   spaces with Xs.
 *
 *   This file must be included after {_mnudefs.i}
