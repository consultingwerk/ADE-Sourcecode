/*  When the master layout record is changed, all other layouts must be changed
    in a similar manner, if they had the same original attributes.  Further, if
    this change is undoable, then the corresponding _ACTION record must record
    the RECID's of the _L records (beyond that of the Master Layout _L) that must
    be undone if the user decides to undo the change.  This include file creates a
    comma delimited list of recids of _L's that need to be undone.  This list ends
    in a comma, so only n - 1 entries need to be processed.

    &Master_L    -  This is the name of the buffer containing the _L of the master
                    layout.              
    &FLD1        -  This is the name of a field must be synchronized
