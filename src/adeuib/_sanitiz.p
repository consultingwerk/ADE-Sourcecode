Description:
    Go through all the _U records and verify that we have valid widgets
    associated with each one. Then go through all the widgets and verify
    that we have a valid _U record for it.
    
    Other checks:
     1) delete _TRG's without matching _U's
    
Input Parameters:
   <None>
   
Output Parameters:
   <None>
