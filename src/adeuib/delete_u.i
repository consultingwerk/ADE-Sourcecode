File: delete_u.i

Description:
   Include file that deletes the widgets for the current _U record.
   [Called from wind-close, dialog-close, delselected.]
   
   This routine deletes frame level widgets and their children and
   selects the _U record as DELETED and not selected.  It also deletes
   windows with their popup-menus and menubars (but not children).
   
Input Parameters:
   &TRASH  -  True if objects are to be truely deleted, else select the objects
              as being deleted. 

	This &TRASH parameter was implemented by Ross Hunter on March 12,
	1993.  I am concerned that we will want to undo it someday, when
	we allow undoing of window and dialog box deletion.  In general,
	I don't like destroying information.  On the other hand, it is nice
	to "clean-up" and not keep unwanted temp-table records around.
	Currently delete_u.i is invoked from 7 places in uibmproc.i and
	uibmtrig.i.  These places are:
	   In uibmproc.i:                                           &TRASH
		1) In DeleteDialogBoxes to delete a dialog box			TRUE
		2) In DeleteSelectedComposite to delete frames			FALSE
		3) In delselected to delete to delete selected objects	FALSE
		4) In dialog-close to close a dialog box				TRUE
		5) In wind-close to close a window						TRUE
	   In uibmtrig.i:
		6) In CHOOSE OF MENU-ITEM mi_close to close a window	TRUE
		7) In CHOOSE OF MENU-ITEM mi_cut to cut objects			TRUE

Output Parameters:
   <None>

Note:  This routine should never be called when _U is a LABEL.  (this is because
       it will also delete the linked fill-in without also deleting the triggers
       on the fill-in.).

     /* Check if the object is an HTML Mapping Field. If so, we don't need to 
     remove it from the Treeview display. This call would typically come as part 
     of a _recreat.p call, such as when changing an HTML Field's data type or 
     initial value from its Property Sheet. The call would come in as TRASH = 
     FALSE. Since nothing about the field in the Treeview object has changed and 
     the object is being recreated anyways, we don't remove the object. Doing 
     so leads to problems recreating the field with the _und* calls. The calls 
     don't handle the undo delete (recreate) of objects displayed in a Treeview. 
     Further, HTML Fields were never intended to be deleted anyways. Note that 
     when TRASHing the object (see the DeleteObject call a few lines above here) 
     we always remove the Treeview object.   -jep 08/09/2000 */
