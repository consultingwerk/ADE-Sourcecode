File: _callqry.p

Description:
   This code will bring up the dialog box frame that allows the developer
   to define the files and their query relationships used in a browse.

Input Parameters:
    prRECID - RECID of _U record 
    pcMode - Mode of operation (A comma delimitted string)
                 ?, "" or "NORMAL"   -- Edit only
                 "QUERY-ONLY"        -- don't show "Fields" option
                 "CHECK-FIELDS"      -- Don't OK dialog until fields have
                                          been entered
                 "NO-FREEFORM-QUERY" -- Don't enable the freeform query button.
