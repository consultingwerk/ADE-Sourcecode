File: _chklbls.p

Description: Calculates the _frmx variable to draw fields in a container.

Input Paramaters:
    font - font of the frame the fields are being drawn into (_L._FONT)

Output Paramaters:
    none      

Author: Gerry Seidl

Date Created: 1995

Notes: Before 10.1C this program handled all the field types that could be added
       in the container, they could be SmartDataObject fields, SmartBussinesObjects fields, or
       DB fields dropped from the 'DB Fields tool'.
       Due to the introduction of DataViews, include files could be used now in order to
       select the SmartDataViewer fields. This new feature raises a bug
       reported in OE00119743 "Cannot create SDV w/ include without db connection".

       In order to fix that bug, and starting in 10.1C this file was splitted
       in two more files. This file now, calls the appropiate file according to the
       field types that are being drawn in the container. The files to be called are:

       adeuib/_chklblsds.p: This is called when we are drawing files from a datasource,
                            the container in which the files are drawn is a viewer.
       adeuib/_chklblsdb.p: This is called when we are drawing database files
                            using the 'DB List' tool, the container in which
                            the files are drawn could be Windows, Dialogs,etc.
