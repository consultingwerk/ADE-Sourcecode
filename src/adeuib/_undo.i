File: _undo.i

Description:
   This include file defines the _action temp table that is used to implement
   the undo mechanism.  Associated with this are its shared variables that
   are described below.

   Implementation:  There are several actions that one would like to be able to
   undo.  The following is a list of actions that are desirable to undo:
   delete, move, resize, create, property sheet changes, color/font changes.
   Also, "unlimited undo" and the capability to "redo" would be a good feature
   to have in a graphical system.

   When an action occurs, and if it is considered to be an undoable action, a
   new action record is created to denote the START of the action.  This is
   followed by the addition of one or more action records for each object that
   the action is applicable to. Finally a new action that denotes the END of
   the action is created.

   When the user does an undo, the action records between the START action
   record and the END action record are deleted from the _action temp-table
   after the action is undone.  Relevant information is stored in the
   _data field in character form for use when the undo occurs.  When the END
   action record is created, the _data field of this record contains the
   _seq-num of the START action record.  This is maintained for performance
   reasons.

   Example: User selects a button and deletes it.  The following records are
     added to the _action temp-table in the order shown below:
	StartDelete
        Delete   <--- This record contains information related to the button
        EndDelete


Input Parameters: <None>

Output Parameters: <None>
