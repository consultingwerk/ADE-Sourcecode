Description:
    This routine is part of the UIB Character Run Window capability,
    which consists of the following procedures, scripts/batch files:

    * adeuib/_ttyss.p  PROGRESS
          Establishes the PROGRESS Winchar client session by calling
          _progres directly (Windows) or running script ttysx (Motif).
          Writes the RUN messages via the character message/command
          file (e.g., p12345m.tty) to the PROGRESS Character session.

    * adecomm/_ttysr.p  PROGRESS
          Startup procedure of the PROGRESS Character session which
          executes the UIB temp file in the Character Run Window
          (xterm under Motif; DOS Shell under Windows).

    * adeuib/_ttysx.p  PROGRESS
          Closes the Character Run Window by deleting the command .tty file.

    * $DLC/bin/ttysx     /dev/sh
          Executes the UIB Character Run Window as a UNIX character client
          in an xterm window.

    * <run_tty_name>  UNIX/DOS-file
          Used as message/command channel between UIB and its Character Run
          Window. Has the form "p12345m.tty".
