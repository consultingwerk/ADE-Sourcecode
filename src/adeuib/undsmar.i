/* 
 * Filename: undsmar.i
 * Description:  include file with code originally in undsmar.p
 *   this file is shared by undsmar.p as well as _setpntr.p and uibmproa.i
 *   _setpntr.p determines what the pointer should look like when the user
 *        attempts to drop an object unto a window
 *   uibmproe.i uses to determine if you can drop an object onto a window
 *
 * There are some errors in a run that we want to trap.  For example,
 * running code that requires database connections when there are
 * none connected or when not all required databases are connected
 * will raise a STOP condition. Assume that is the most likely case
 * and give the user the chance to connect to a database. Do this
 * regardless of whether the object is rcode or soure code. Part of the
 * fix for 98-12-28-020.
 *
 * Included by: _undsmar.p
 *              sookver.i (which in turn is included in uibmproa.i and _setpntr.p
 *
 * Created: 02/98 SLK
 * Updated: 01/99 JEP 98-12-28-020
 * Parameters {1} - File to run - Character 
              {2} - Handle to set when started 
              {3} - Message to display when not found - character 
              {4} - Variable to set to true when remote 
                    Currently also used to conditionally compile, 
                    because _setpntr.p don't need to support remote 
                    and does not have the _h_func vasriable defined
