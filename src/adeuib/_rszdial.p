Description:
    Resize a "dialog-box" in the UIB.  Remember that this DIALOG-BOX is really
    a window with a contained frame.  We want to allow the user to resize the
    dialog-box up to the screen size and down to the size of all the contained
    widgets.  
    
Input Parameters:
    <None>

Output Parameters:
   <None>
