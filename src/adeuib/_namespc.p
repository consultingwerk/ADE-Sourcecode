     Allow XFTR to register names of variables or procedures that cannot be used 
     by UIB users.  For example, if an XFTR creates a procedure, then we would not
     want the developer to create their own internal procedure with the same name.  
     Similarly, if the XFTR defines some variables, UIB users should be restricted
     from using those variables.

  Input Parameters:
      pi_context - The context ID (usually the same as the RECID)
                   of the procedure object to access.  If this is
                   the context for a widget in the procedure, then 
                   the procedure is found anyway.
                   If this is unknown then get the current procedure.
                   [If a Procedure Object cannot be found then we
                   return "ERROR".]
      pc_mode - RESERVE|UNRESERVE [VARIABLE|PROCEDURE [NAME|NAMES]]
      pc_list - comma-delimeted list of names to add or remove

  Output Parameters:
    <none>

  Comments: Warnings are given if you try to reserve a name that is already
            in use (but the reservation is made, so that if you delete the
            widget that uses the name, you will not be able to use it again).
            
            You can UNRESERVE any name, even one that it not RESERVED, and 
            there will be no warning.
